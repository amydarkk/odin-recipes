        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 carrot</li>
            <li>1 white onion</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery</li>
            <li>8.8 oz 250g ground beef (mince), (250g)</li>
            <li>8.8 oz 250g ground pork (mince), (250g)</li>
            <li>2 cups sieved tomatoes (passata), (470g)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 cup (230ml) red wine, (240ml)</li>
            <li>4 cups beef stock, (1 litre)</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf, (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the carrot, onion and celery and sweat the vegetables gently in a large frying pan with the olive oil. Once the vegetables are soft add the ground beef and pork and cook until browned.</li>
            <li>If there is a lot of excess fat in the pan, drain some out. Add the red wine and reduce by half. Once the wine has reduced by half add the passata, tomato paste and half of the beef stock and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir the sauce then add the bay leaf. Let it simmer on a low heat uncovered for 2 and a half hours topping up with the rest of the stock as it reduces.</li>
            <li><strong>Remember</strong> to check on the ragu every now and then to stir it and add extra stock or water if needed.</li>
            <li>To serve with pasta add cooked pasta into the ragu and toss or use as desired.</li>
        </ol>
