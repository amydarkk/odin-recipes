        <h2>Quick and easy creamy garlic pasta</h2>
        <p>This creamy tagliatelle recipe makes a comforting midweek meal. Any long pasta will work, so use whatever you have in the cupboard.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300g tagliatelle</li>
            <li>20g salted butter</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>150ml chicken stock</li>
            <li>200ml double cream</li>
            <li>85g parmesan grated</li>
            <li>20g flat-leaf parsley roughly chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by cooking the pasta following pack instructions. Meanwhile, melt the butter in your largest frying pan. Once foaming, add the garlic and 25 twists of a black pepper mill. Cook for 4-5 mins, until the garlic is light golden and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in the flour to form a paste. Stir for 1-2 mins, then slowly whisk in the chicken stock until you have a smooth sauce. Pour in the double cream and sprinkle in most of the parmesan. Stir until everything is melted and combined, then season to taste.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pasta straight into the sauce, alongside a good splash of the cooking water. Mix thoroughly, adding a little more pasta water if necessary, until you have a thick and glossy sauce.</li>
            <li>Divide between four bowls and serve topped with the chopped parsley and remaining parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
